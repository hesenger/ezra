# Ezra

Ezra is a HTTP web server build based on orinal protocol specification,
using TDD from the scratch. It was built completely using managed C# code.

Ezra is a fully recreational project made for learning and not intended
to be used in production.

# Development

The project was developed using NET 6 and VSCode in a Mac M1, so
running it in a Windows/Visual Studio environment might require
some tweaks.
